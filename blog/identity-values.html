                <h2 class="hlearn">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
                <p class="alearn">I worked closely with a colleague for a couple of years, he left the company on poor terms and was unable to get a reference. He asked if I would be willing to act as a referee for him.This placed me in a difficult position, I wanted to help my friend but was uncomfortable lying about our working relationship. After weighing up my loyalty to my friend, and my discomfort with lying about our working relationship. I explained my position and that I would not be able to act as his referee.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="hlearn">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
                <p class="alearn">I was born and lived in Singapore until I was 8 years old, I then migrated to New Zealand. I returned and lived in Singapore from the ages of 18 to 21. The experience of returning has helped me recognise my identity, and the values I hold dear. Growing up in Singapore, I was taught the importance of achievement, perhaps to an unhealthy degree? A person could be measured based purely on documented achievements, and there is immense pressure to excel. Returning to New Zealand, the country where I spent my teenage years, has helped me appreciate all that this country has to offer. I pride myself on being a person who values my friends and family and all the good things life has been able to offer me. I do my best to think of others and strive to always better myself.</p>
            </div>
        <h1>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h1>
            <div>
                <h2 class="hlearn">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h2>
                <p class="alearn">I gel naturally with other people and pick skills up quickly, I listen and work with a team well. I think the biggest barrier in my career development is the loss of passion, and a lack of certification.</p>
            </div>
            <div>    
                <h2 class="hlearn">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
                <p class="alearn">If I take the time to apply myself and work hard towards my goal, I feel confident I can reach my target. The learning obstacles that I fear the most on this journey, are that I may struggle with complex concepts and give in to the temptation of giving up. I want to use this journey as an opportunity to not only learn about the world of development, but to also strengthen my discipline and master my fear over that feeling of 'this is too hard, maybe I should give up'.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="hlearn">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2>
                <p class="alearn">In a recent short term contracting position I undertook, I was to be trained up on my role in a short space of time by a person leaving the organisation. I felt this person was not very invested in making sure I was ready to undertake the role. This made things difficult for me and placed tension on our very short working relationship. I attempted to resolve this by keeping small talk and distractions to a minimum. I don't like the idea of immediately escalating an issue, but in retrospect, I would have suggested my manager join us for a couple of hours of training a day, this would have ensured the knowledge of the role's processes were not held by one person alone, and that my trainer would have been a little more motivated to ensure they were providing a concise handover.</p>
