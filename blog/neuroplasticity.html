                <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
                <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
                <p class="rdinosaur">Neuroplasticity is the concept that a person's brain is malleable. The brain is able to modify and adapt in response to experience and stimulus. Understanding and embracing this mindset is beneficial as it helps people better learn and engage with material.</p>
                <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
                <p class="ldinosaur">Understanding that the brain is able to modify itself to better accommodate learning something new can help me overcome fear that 'I might not be cut out for this type of work'. Seeing challenges and roadblocks in learning as 'when' not 'if' problems and believing that through practice and repetition I am able to master new things will help me immensely.</p>
                <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
                <p class="rdinosaur">A lot of the concepts we have explored so far during Foundations are good ways to increase neuroplasticity. For example, finding clarity, setting goals, practicing mindfulness, altering your mindset and getting into a routine are all recommended ways to give yourself a leg up on your neuroplastic learning journey.</p>
                <h2>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging</h2>
                <p class="ldinosaur">This quick video is a good way to get a quick understanding of what neuroplasticity is, and how it works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g</p>
                <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
                <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
                <p class="rdinosaur">A Growth Mindset can be described as a way of viewing challenges in learning something new as 'when' not 'if' problems. It is the mindset that with enough practice, effort and conviction anything can be learned and mastered. A fixed mindset is the belief that 'this is too hard', or 'I might not be cut out for this', the belief they may not be able to achieve their goals. A growth mindset is relevant to our Dev Academy learning journey as JavaScript and coding is foreign to a lot of us, and can be very overwhelming at times. Keeping in mind that the struggle is temporary and that we can overcome it with enough practice and effort is vital.</p>
                <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
                <p class="ldinosaur">Exploring these two ideas has helped me see that I have had a fixed mindset in the past. It was a surprise reading about the difference between a fixed and growth mindset and thinking, 'Wow! That sounds a lot like me!' It isn't easy, but I want to continue to employ a growth mindset with the challenges this course provides and all future learning.</p>
                <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
                <p class="rdinosaur">Its easy to fall into a spiral listening to your subconscious when feeling overwhelmed. I know now this is partÂ of having a fixed mindset. Reminding myself that the biggest factor holding me back is my own way of looking at these challenges and adopting what I have learnt so far through Foundations will help me learn and overcome my learning hurdles.</p>
                <h2>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging</h2>
                <p class="ldinosaur">This video has some cool illustrations and explains the concepts of growth and fixed mindsets well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWn_TJTrnU</p>
                <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</h2>
                <p class="rdinosaur">I wrote about how I have a tendency to give up when overwhelmed in my learning plan. I now know this is part of having a fixed mindset, I want to make a conscious effort to remember what I have learned when things start to get tough. The power of positive thinking will help me get through the struggles this course will present me with. It is something I hope to ingrain and take with me well into my future.</p>
