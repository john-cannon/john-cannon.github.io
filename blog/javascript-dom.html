                <p class="rdinosaur">We can start off by discussing the difference between CSS and HTML. Think of a writer and a publishing team, the writer is the one who puts pen to paper and actually writes the content we see in our media. Most writers will likely have their final draft typed up or written out with nothing to 'dress up' their work. What would it look like if we wrote a few thousand words in a Word document? We can assume it will probably be quite plain. This is when CSS, or the publishing team, comes in to play. They take the unformatted text the writer has produced, they format it, add color and style to it, and make it easy for our eyes to digest. One cannot survive without the other, they both require each other to come together to create a finished, sleek, easily digestible product!</p>
                <p class="ldinosaur">What is an example from every day life we can use to explain what 'control flow' within JavaScript is? Your daily routine! Most of us shambling through life, cursed to this dreary existence go through our days in the same order. We wake up, we get ready for the day, we commute to our jobs, we commute back home, we prepare dinner and then we sidle into bed to start the day again. What do we do when there is a track fault, meaning we can't catch the train to work? What about when we forget to pick up spaghetti and now we can't make dinner? What do we do when we realise our work pants are still sopping wet when we are getting ready in the morning? By and large we will follow the same routine every day, but when something goes wrong or disrupts our routine, we will find alternative methods to get to our goals. We might have to take the car in to work, or just jog along the highway. We might nip down the road and pick up dinner, or maybe just eat plain spaghetti sauce out of a mug. We might throw those pants in the dryer, or just wear bike shorts into the office. Within the context of programming, a control flow is a set order in which lines of code are executed. Control flow determines the paths in which various functions are carried out. If A occurs, follow X, if B occurs, follow Y, so on and so forth.</p>
                <p class="rdinosaur">Lets discuss JavaScript 'loops', we can use another example from everyday life to illustrate this concept. Imagine every time you walk past the kitchen sink and see dirty dishes in there, you wash and dry them. This happens everytime you walk past the sink, if there is a dirty dish in there you wash and dry it on the spot! The only time you don't do this is when the sink is empty. Similar to this, a loop in JavaScript is something you do over and over again until a certain condition is met, like all the dishes being washed and dried. This is not the only type of loop that exists in a JavaScript context. Lets picture a Magic 8-Ball, sitting there and shaking your 8-Ball over and over looking for different answers is similar is similar to running a JavaScript loop again and again looking for different results.</p>
                <p class="ldinosaur">The DOM in JavaScript is a program overseeing all of the elements that come together to present a finished web document. The DOM (Document Object Model) provides us with a huge number of ways to pull information, maniupulate and observe everything occuring within a web document. We might find ourselves using the DOM when trying to troubleshoot and debug our own code, or when we want to take a look at how something has been done on a website. "I like the way this site has its content laid out, let me use the DOM to poke around and see how I can replicate something similar in my own webpage."</p>
                <p class="rdinosaur">To illustrate the difference between pulling information from an array and an object, we must first define them both. An array functions like a list, it has a name defining it and multiple items within it. An object is like a business card, it also has a name defining it but instead holds pieces of information. The information it holds is usually related to its name. Pulling information from an array is like saying, "What was the fourth item on the shopping list?". Pulling information from an object is like saying, "What was the email address on Trevor's business card?".</p>
                <p class="ldinosaur">Functions are vital for web documents. If your page is going to do anything other than simply list information you will require functions. Functions are in charge of a vast range of complex actions. A good way to think of functions is like the wiring in the halls of your house. You have your HTML which are the bones of the building and the CSS which is the paint work and posters up on the wall. Lastly you have your JavaScript functionality which ties things together and provides your home with all its functionality!</p>
