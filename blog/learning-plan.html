            <h2 class="hlearn">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p class="alearn">This is something I have had a lot of time to think about. I want to be able to pour my passion and energy into a rewarding career path. One that leads to better opportunities and leaves me feeling satisfied. Unfortunately, I don't have a clear goal in my mind, I  envy those that do! I have struggled not knowing what this is, at this point in my life, I want to pick something sensible and make a real go of it. I enjoy computers recreationally and want to be able to learn more about them while making a living.</p>

        <div>    
            <h2 class="hlearn">A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
            <p class="alearn">I think I have what it takes to reach my targets, provided I put in the effort to meet them. My limitations are my lack of discipline and a tendency to give in when I am met with resistance. I feel I have made strides since the beginning of this course in this regard, however, in order for me to excel along this career path, I need to commit and strengthen my sense of discipline.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 class="hlearn">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p class="alearn">I have touched on this a little already, but I want to be able to master my fear of the unknown, and strengthen my discipline. I want to 'get comfortable with being uncomfortable' and understand that a problem I am yet to overcome is a 'not yet' problem. I want to be strong enough not to give in to procrastination, and get into the routine of tackling my workload first and then allowing myself to relax guilt free after the work is done.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 class="hlearn">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
                <li class="llearn">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
                <p class="alearn">I will bring my routine and sense of professionalism to my tasks every day. I have no reservations about reaching out to my cohort mates for help and am happy to lend assistance where I can. I want to learn to 'think like a developer' and solve problems through investigative work as much as I can.</p>
                <li class="llearn">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
                <p class="alearn">Take a break and learn to not lose my resolve when I feel my tasks are mounting. I have reached out to my facilitator for advice and this was an excellent way for me to ground myself. I will continue to 'get comfortable with being uncomfortable'. It helps that we have been reminded more than once that we will feel like this as we get further into the course. We are all facing the same challenges, its up to not to listen to the voice of doubt.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 class="hlearn">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
            <p class="alearn">In line with what I have already said regarding discipline and routine, I will get started on my work as soon as the week starts and try to make as much progress between Monday to Friday as I can. No one wants to be stressing about finishing their work at the last minute, I want to make good progress and do it when the facilitation team is available during the week.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 class="hlearn">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
            <p class="alearn">I expect the same things from the facilitation team that I would expect from a manager. I expect them to be easy to approach, I expect them to be direct and clear with me, and I expect support when I need it and reach out for it.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 class="hlearn">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h2>
            <p class="alearn">I luckily have no commitments during the course, however, I feel that being able to step away for a break is very important. As much as possible I want to reserve my weekends for a chance to decompress. This most likely won't be an option during Bootcamp! I understand this and am prepared, I will continue to follow a routine of getting started with my work early in the day so I have time to take breaks and still make significant progress through my workload.</p>
