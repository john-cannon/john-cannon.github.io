                <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
                <p class="rdinosaur">Emotional intelligence is a person's ability to recognise and manage their emotions. Their behaviour is guided by their knowledge of their own emotions and of those around them. People with a high EQ are able to differentiate between different feelings and control them to a degree to suit their environments. Peter Salovey and John Mayer's definition of EQ is "The ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behaviour". Emotional intelligence is also the ability to understand interpersonal dynamics through intelligence, empathy and emotions.</p>
                <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
                <p class="ldinosaur">IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is the measure of a person's raw intelligence through standardised tests, while EQ (Emotional Quotient) is a person's ability to recognise and manage their emotions. A person with high EQ has the ability to discern and control their emotions, perceive the emotions of others and act accordingly. The abilities of someone with high IQ relate more to their ability to learn and apply knowledge to tasks, connect the dots and problem solve.</p>
                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p class="rdinosaur">EQ is important for helping us work better with people. Being successful in the workplace requires more than being able to complete a task well. Being a team player, communicating well and building strong relationships with colleagues is key, and part of what makes someone a desirable candidate for employment.</p>
