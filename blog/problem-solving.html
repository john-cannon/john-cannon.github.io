                <p class="rdinosaur">While coding and trying different methods to get my work functional, I kept encountering error messages. I was unsure of exactly what the error message was trying to tell me, but I knew what I had tried did not work, I would clear my last line of code and try again. I wasn't sure exactly what the error messages like 'js:5:10' were telling me. I spoke with a friend and realised the error messages were telling me exactly where my code was going wrong. A lot of my errors were caused by an extra parenthesis in the wrong place, or a simple spelling error. When I was unsure, I would look at a chunk of code I was unsure about, and read it out aloud line by line, I would scan over everything closely to ensure I had not missed anything, or included anything by accident. It was frustrating being sure that my code was correct, only to find a simple typing error was causing my issues, it has taught me to be careful and ensure I am not missing anything. A simple spelling error in a block of written text will not affect much, but it makes a huge difference when it comes to writing code!</p>
                <p class="ldinosaur">I had many opportunities to test my problem solving skills during my coding process. I spoke with my peers for guidance and would read aloud through my code, this helped me identify where I was confused and walk through it through it with someone else. When a peer was not available, simply talking through my code out aloud with myself was also an excellent way to help me examine my work slowly and surely, I used the blank space on my wall, just above my laptops screen in lieu of a rubber ducky. Taking my time to really stop and look thoroughly through an eror message helped me get myself unstuck more than once. I tripped myself up with rogue parentheses more than once!</p>
