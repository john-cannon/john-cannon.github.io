                <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
                <p class="rdinosaur">I have a name for the way I feel when I come up against a challenge I feel is insurmountable. I have a fixed mindset and begin to convince myself too easily that I don't have what it takes to get through the work. I need to consciously remind myself that I can get through obstacles with effort and application, I need to employ a growth mindset.</p>
                <p class="rdinosaur">Prior to this course I might try to learn something new, feel like none of it makes sense and drop it like a hot rock. I need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, this is one of the many mantras I have taken note of during my Foundations journey. It is not easy but I need to consciously remind myself my lack of understanding in the now is a 'when' problem, not an 'if problem'.</p>
                <p class="rdinosaur">One more thing I feel I have learned during this course is that I need to have a bit more self confidence. I am too quick to immediately feel like I don't have what it takes. It will help to have a bit more faith in myself and I feel this will help me get through the rest of this course, and future hurdles.</p>
                <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                <p class="ldinosaur">I know it sounds cheesy, but this question brings to mind the phrase "United we stand, divided we fall". Coding can be a demanding and complex process and requires our peers for success. In order to work in a healthy, respectful and constructive way we need to share values, we need to be empathetic to those we work with and we need to be aware of our own actions and how we are affecting others. This not only applies to the world of programming and other lines of collaborative work but the process of learning. Learning something foreign and complex can be tough and we will need help from our mentors and our fellow students, we cannot share and exchange knowledge unless we are able to show each other respect and conduct ourselves in a way that helps us grow. Values, empathy, and self awareness in both learning and programming are the foundations and means to a healthy working environment.</p>
                <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                <p class="rdinosaur">The power of a mindset, the power of being aware of what you are thinking and feeling. Consciously making the effort to correct your negative thoughts. Prior to Foundations I may not have put much stock into the 'power of positive thinking', but taking time to look into it and trying it out for myself has been a process that has helped me learn a lot about myself. This is related more to the tech side of things but something else I found surprising was learning about what goes on under the hood of a realised website. I have come into this course with no prior knowledge of coding, I found it very surprising that the flesh and bones that come together to make up a website are very much like the convoluted folders I create to categorise and store odd files and documents on my own personal computer. There are chief files that are responsible for different parts of the websites. These files are interwoven, deeply connected and communicate with each other in all sorts of ways. I don't really know what I expected, but to see it as a collection of folders and files is something I find quite fascinating!</p>
                <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                <p class="ldinosaur">Reading about myself and my fixed mindset was the most challenging aspect of my core learning. The core material covered has forced me to accept that I am my biggest enemy when it comes to learning and growing. Feelings of frustration and thoughts of giving up are all too familiar to me, but experiencing those things now and immediately being able to recognise them as traits of a fixed mindset help me to disregard them and reflect on my tendency to throw in the towel. Having a bit of self confidence, practicing good habits and reminding myself that its 'all in my head' are vital for me to be able to push through the hard times and come out on the other side.</p>
                <h2>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
                <p class="rdinosaur">These are teachings that can applied to more than just web development. These are ideas that can help a person better navigate everyday life. Dev Academy focuses on giving us a strong coding foundation to enter the world of development as well as giving us the tools to make sure we are desirable hires. I have taken the following blurb directly from the Student Handbook but feel it rings true here "Tech employers aren't looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code. They're looking for exceptional human beings who will enhance the culture of their team." What good is all the coding knowledge in the world if you can't work well with a team? Having good skills and being a team player who fits in is vital to being a desirable job candidate.</p>
                <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
                <p class="ldinosaur">Absolutely not! I feel like I keep talking about growth and fixed mindsets constantly but this is the piece of learning from the core material that has stuck with me the most. I have given up more than once in the past when things prove to be tough or difficult. I have gone through most of my life with a fixed mindset and I don't want to do that anymore. Embracing this new knowledge will go on to help me with coding, my future jobs and all sorts of other challenges in my life. Conscious listening and looping while discussing with others will strengthen my communication skills. Recognising someone as having a higher EQ or IQ will help me to work better with all types of people. Coding skills will help us to find rewarding jobs that challenge us to grow. But the core materials can be applied to everyday life, and I feel like this is more invaluable than skill specific knowledge.</p>
