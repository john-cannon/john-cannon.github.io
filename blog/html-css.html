                <p class="ldinosaur">IDs and Classes are both known as 'hooks'. Common tags used in basic HTML writing such as H1, P and DIV are incredibly helpful, but not always descriptive enough for us to be as specific as we might want to be!</p>
                <p class="rdinosaur">Both IDs and classes are special 'identifiers' that we can assign to various parts of our HTML, we can then use these identifiers to apply blanket rules across our work.</p>
                <p class="ldinosaur">We need to remember that IDs are unique and can only be used once per element, while classes can be applied to multiple elements across a page. You can even use multiple classes on the same element!</p>
                <p class="rdinosaur">For the purpose of a very on the nose analogy, lets think of classes, as classes! Your 'Year 13 History' class, or your entire 'Year 9' high school group, maybe even your 'Kahu 2022' Enspiral cohort! A class can apply to a group, with changes affecting everything within that class. Lets say a uniform policy gets implemented, everyone in your year group.</p>
                <p class="ldinosaur">If your class can be compared to your history class, then your ID is like your name! There are lots of people in your class/year group/cohort, but only one of you, maybe there is another Peter, but there isn't another Peter Smith is there?</p>
